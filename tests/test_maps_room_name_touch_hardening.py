"""The Atlas builder's room-name long-press (maps.js, the `for (const rg of
isoDiv.querySelectorAll("g.lroom[data-room]"))` block) — 2026-09-16 finding:
the one gesture on this tab with no touch-action of its own and no pointer
capture, so a real finger's natural micro-drift during the hold could read to
the browser as the start of a scroll (.lv-stage is overflow:auto) and get
silently taken over for panning instead of completing the press.

This gesture is wired inline inside maps.js's render(ctx) — reaching it with
a real pointerdown/pointermove/pointerup sequence needs the WHOLE Atlas tab
built (ctx.state.mapsTab="lights", a real model, every render() dependency),
which is disproportionate to what a touch-target hardening fix needs proving
— the door-circle drag handler right next to this one (_wireDoorCircle) is
exercised the same limited way for the same reason (test_lights_door_circle.py).
So this pins the fix at the source level instead: the exact statements a
regression would have to remove or corrupt to reintroduce either bug this
session found — the missing touch-action/capture, and the self-caught
`longPressed` guard mistake (an early draft read `if (!lpTimer && !ring)
return;`, which is wrong because a FIRED setTimeout id stays truthy, so it
would have let post-arm movement cancel an already-armed hold; caught and
fixed before it ever ran).
